<h3 style="color: antiquewhite;"> CHOSEN BY MATTHEW BUCK, PHOTOGRAPHIC DIRECTOR</h3>
        
<p style="color: antiquewhite;">'This is one of my favourite Traveller videos
because the tone of it perfectly embodies that
feeling you get on day three or four of a much-needed
holiday. After the initial few days of assimilating from
your normal, busy, hectic, crowded and noisy real life, you
slip into blissful slow-motion. The world feels heightened,
it looks better, it smells better, it tastes better – and
the Italians are experts at slow living.'

<h3 style="color: antiquewhite;">CHOSEN BY GRAINNE MCBRIDE, CHIEF SUB-EDITOR</h3>
    
<p style="color: antiquewhite;">'This is as close to travel as it gets, virtually-just look
at the colour of that sea! And the honey light of the early evening
when the musicians start to jam and the chilled beers clink. But best
of all is the narrator’s lilting Caribbean accent- sunshine to my ears
right now.'
