 Travelling can teach you more than any university course. You learn about the culture of
the country you visit. If you talk to locals, you will likely learn about their thinking,
habits, traditions and history as well.Some of my most cherished memories are from the
times when I was travelling. If you travel, you can experience things that you could
never experience at home. You may see beautiful places and landscapes that do not exist
where you live. You may meet people that will change your life, and your thingking.
You may try activities that you have never tried before.
